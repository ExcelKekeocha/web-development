<p class="text2">The Reds made it 11 wins in the 12 games of the head coach’s tenure – and seven clean sheets – with a 1-0 victory at RB Leipzig in the Champions League in midweek.

    Attention has now turned to the Premier League meeting with last season’s runners-up, which kicks off at 4.30pm GMT in the capital.
    
    Ahead of the game, Slot spoke to the media about what he expects against the Gunners, the foundations behind Liverpool’s defensive record and how the squad are navigating such a busy period.
    
    Read every word from the press conference – in addition to his squad injury update here – below…
    
    On the toughness of the test he expects against Arsenal on Sunday…
    
    I said before the game and after the game that I expect a lot from Chelsea this season, and I think they showed it also last Sunday at Anfield. They are a similar team to Arsenal when it comes to playing style, they also like to go with their full-back inside and come into the same formation as Arsenal. But if you look at the last two seasons, Arsenal were far ahead of us but also above Chelsea, so you would assume that playing Arsenal would even be more difficult. But let’s see at the end of the season where Chelsea and Arsenal both are. But normally you would expect, because it’s also an away game, that this one is even more difficult than Chelsea at home and we all see how difficult Chelsea at home was.
    
    </p>
    <h4 class="text3">Team Comparison — English Premier League</h4>

    <p class="text4">On it being a ‘statement’ if Liverpool were to win this weekend’s game…

        We all know that taking points from your competitor [is important]. And nobody knows in this early stage who is going to be your competitor or your biggest competitor, but I think we all know that Arsenal will be one of them and then dropping points against them or winning points against them, that is always important. So, you’re right, I think it was three draws and one loss [against Arsenal and Manchester City] last season so if you use simple mathematics, if Liverpool could have won all three of them I think the league table would have been a bit different. It’s difficult to win an away leg against Arsenal, City or all the other ones but it’s something we are trying on Sunday definitely.
        
        On the excitement for matches of this magnitude…
        
        In the life of a manager – and I’m talking about a manager, I don’t know how it is for the players – the excitement is for 10 to 15 minutes after the game, when you’re still on the pitch. You walk off it and then you already start to think, ‘OK, what am I going to say to the players next when they all come in?’ And then afterwards you go to the press conference and then your focus is already on the next game. So the excitement for a manager is maybe 10 to 15 minutes after good results. But it’s a very nice fixture to be in, that’s clear. But there are many, many nice fixtures to be in and Arsenal away is one of them.
        
        On how Liverpool’s start to the season compares to the targets he had set…
        
        It’s not that if I start the season I have targets to how many points you want to have after a certain amount of games. It is what I just said about the joy you have after a game is 10 to 15 minutes, and that’s also the way I look at the fixture list. So it’s always the next one you try to prepare and not looking too far ahead because that’s of no use in football. You don’t go into a season thinking, ‘After 10 games I want to have so many points.’
        
        No, the only thing you want is your team in the best possible way and to prepare the team in the best possible way. For that, you have your training sessions, your team meetings and there is where your main focus is and not so much into how many points and where we exactly are. It’s just trying to improve every single day and that’s what we’re trying now. And that’s also what’s needed, because teams around us do the same.
