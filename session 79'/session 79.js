//oop object oriented progarmming
//oop means a progaring wicth is based on objects
//we asume that each and everything here is a object because a object has some poporties and funuctionallity which automactilly are coding objects will also have have it.
//making our code easier esseplily in games we want are player and emies to function.that is why we use objects all thesse things.
//class class is where we store all the function togethor
// class store functions functions store code.
// reason for creating class
// 1.the code becomes more organized
//2. whenever we want to use thoose functions again we can just simlpy call the class
